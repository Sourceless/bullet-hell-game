bullet-hell-game
================

A bullet hell game with no name (yet)

Some things I'm trying to learn and implement with this:
* Gamestates and a game state manager (state manager in progress)
* Better class system (if I can find a decent tutorial I'll use that, otherwise
  some lib)
* Entity Component System (not started)
* Collision with Quadtrees (not started - unless love.physics does this already)
* Interesting bullet patterns (not started)
* Level format, possibly serialised (not started)
* Event system [possibly part of ECM?] (not started)
* Pixel graphics by scaling up (not started)
* High scores (not started, easy)
* Save system (not started)
* Ridiculous colours (careful there)
* Make something half decent (...this could be difficult)

Things I might try:
* Procedural generation (i.e. Endless Mode)
* Choice of ship/character
